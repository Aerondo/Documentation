**I am excited to announce Aerondo goes live today. I hope this day will also be the kickoff for a new community of people who use cloud-first and mobile-first technologies to manage data of the general aviation. This platform and the supporting community is build for everyone who is looking for modern ways and tools to make their life easier in managing data from general
aviation.**

## What it shall become
Aerondo shall become a platform of helpful tools to have fun and save time when it is about management of data originating from general aviation. To realize this, Aerondo uses the latest cloud and mobile technologies to support a wide range of different devices and to give you access to the data and the tools anytime and anywhere. Using the latest technologies enables us to manage this data and connected processes in new ways. Therefore, the digitalization of the general aviation data is just the first step in the lifetime of Aerondo. The real vision of Aerondo is to start a digital transformation of existing data management approaches and procedures in the general aviation into time saving and lean ways.

## How the idea was born
The idea of Aerondo goes back to some technology prototypes I (Daniel Murrmann) developed in the past. As a computer scientist I always want to get in touch with latest technologies. My areas of interesst are especialy web and cloud technologies as well as agile methodologies. So when trying a new technologiy I alway need a use case. Because I am also a private pilot, I started to take some use cases from the general aviation to combine two areas of interesst. After some time, I realized some standanlone use cases. With the start of Aerondo I decided to bring my already developed use cases together in this platform and to provide this tools to other people.

## Available features at the beginning
At the beginning, Aerondo starts with only two features. Those are the personal flight log of a pilot and an analytics feature to give you extensive insights into your flight log from different perspectives. Furthermore you have some default functions similar to other portals on the internet, e.g. managing data to you account like name, address and profile image or password reset.

## Plans for the future
The next steps are to bring more data management and data analytics features (pilot license management, aircraft flight log, etc.) to the platform. After the realization of those features, we start to realize easy connections and wire up of those features. For example, if you make an entry in an aircraft flight log, we can also automatically make an entry in your personal flight log. In the long term, development shall fullfill requests and needs of the community. Therefore I am exited to see the first requests and ideas on [GitHub](https://github.com/Aerondo/Home/issues).
