I am very happy to announce Aerondo goes live today. I hope this day will also be the kickoff for a new community of people 
who use cloud-first and mobile-first technologies to manage their data of the general aviation in a modern way. This platform and the supporting community is build for everyone how is looking for ways and tools to make their life easier in managing generay aviation data by using modern technologies.

1. Intro
1. What it shall become (a platform and a community for transparency and tools to help in daily tasks)
2. How was the idea born? (wanted to try new techs from the cloud and the web universe)
3. The features to the beginning
4. Plans for the future
5. How to become a member of the community and contribute to development.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
