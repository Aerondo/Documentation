## Create a new Flight Log Entry
When developing this feature we took a lot of effort to ensure this feature works without constraints on mobile screens. With just a few taps you can input a complete flight with all data using your mobile. This way it is as easy as possible to input a new flight log entry directly after your flight. 

To create a new flight tap "New" or swipe left to bring up the input form. The input form is intelligent and proposes you known aircrafts, co-pilots, etc. as soon as you typed the first letters and the aircrafts, co-pilots, etc. are known to Aerondo.

The screenshot below shows the input form to create a new flight log entry.

> **A Note to Substitude your Paper Flight Log**
>
> Have in mind that in some countries (e.g. Germany) a paper flight log is mandatory for pilots. In this case the Digital Flight Log of Aerondo can not substitute your paper flight log. But even then you should enter all your flights also into Aerdondos Digital Flight Log to benefit from the extensive management and analytics Features of Aerondo in terms of your flight log.
